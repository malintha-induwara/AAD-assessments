Apache tomcat is not a pure web server it is much more powerfull that


web site -host
web application -deploy


Complete solution for bussniess is called Enterprise level applicaiton


DNS lookup - process

after we type domain name it automatiicly add the protocol

it also add the portnumber

Why cant directly go to IJSE site using the IP address

if you use any technolgoies react,viu, angular in the end  html,css,js 

only The front end come to the client other backend is saved on the server


If all Java EE specification set implemented it called Java EE application server.


quaries are on the server


AJAX use to connect frontend and backend
Backend Technogogies -- Java for Enterprise Applications Eg: ERP Applications Sales,Accounting,HR --

			Python for AI Applications
			
Enterprise applications - scalablity is very important, also security is important, flexible, Customaize

Java SE is basic one
james goslin bring Java EE for develop enterprise application
Java ME - for develop applicaions to mobile devices

We called front-end as client app

Most of the  Enterprises applications are web applications


JCP -- 


Oracle JDK is implimantaion set


Browser has two engines Render engine


A artifact is a final product 

There are few file type extenstions that artifact can have

1)jar
2)war
3)ear


For standalone application we use jar file


Examples of Application server Software / Java EE
JBOX ---> Wild Fly  Redhat maintain it

Java EE Application Server = Web Contaienr + EJB Container
(Full Profile/Full Platform)  (Web Profile)   (EJB Profile)

We put this to mark that we just mention we going to use it  there is no accutal implementation its just only a surface. when the runtime we provide the implementation ( Tomcat)
