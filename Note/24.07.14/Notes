Jason B type can bind object to a jason, we cant do it in Jason P type


Try with reasoures --> auto closable


SRP design principle



DTO design pattern - DTO use to transfer data between layers
to create these database you need to follow bean spec


var is type inference



Request have a get Reader method

we can use it to read the method


jasonb is used to bind jason to a java object (jsonb.fromJson)



we use try with resource in order to auto close  something 

for example if you create a scanner you need to close it but if you create with try with resources you dont have to do it


Serialization and Deserialization

AJAX

ajax is a way to update the website without informing the user

Fetch API
Axious library- MernStack



Ready State in AJAX--- Can be asked in interviews


header is meta data -- broswer also add header


we check readyState because its the only point where the request is ready to check


Use firefox

CORS policy -- when you transfer data between two domains


OPTION is also method is like GET POST


why two options





Pre Flight request -- >it intreact with cors policy, we dont speiclay configure it
there are two requests in pre flight


first agent goes -- OPTION is in category of pre flight
then data goes --POST






There are two types of HTTP Requests

1)Simple Requests
2)PreFlight Requests
